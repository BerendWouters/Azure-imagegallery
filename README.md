[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/berendwouters/Gallery/_apis/build/status/BerendWouters.Azure-imagegallery?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/berendwouters/Gallery/_build/latest?definitionId=26&branchName=master)

This is the 42nd attempt to have an image gallery. This time, I'm using node.js to run a static website in a storage account.
